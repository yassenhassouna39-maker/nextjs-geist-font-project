# Detailed Implementation Plan for Programming Flash Cards App

This plan details the creation and integration of a flash card learning feature for programming. The new feature is built as a protected section accessible only to authenticated users. It uses modern, stylistic UI elements built with typography, spacing, and smooth transitions while incorporating error handling and best practices.

---

## 1. New Feature Structure and File Additions

### A. Flashcards Page Route
- **File:** `src/app/flashcards/page.tsx`
  - **Purpose:** Create a new Next.js page that renders the flash card session.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Import the flash card list component.
    - Use the authentication hook (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`) to check if the user is logged in.
    - If the user is not authenticated, render `<AuthScreen />` (from `src/components/auth/AuthScreen.tsx`) or redirect to the login page.
    - Render a header, instructions, and the FlashCardList component.

### B. Flash Card Components
- **Folder:** `src/components/flashcards/`
  - **File:** `FlashCard.tsx`
    - **Purpose:** Render a single flash card.
    - **Tasks:**
      - Accept a flash card object (id, question, answer) as props.
      - Use local state (e.g. `showAnswer:boolean`) to toggle between question and answer.
      - Add a button labeled “Show Answer” (or “Hide Answer” when toggled) with a smooth transition effect.
      - Apply modern styling using CSS classes (e.g. `.flashcard`, `.flashcard-content`) defined in `src/app/globals.css`.
      - Include error handling: if no valid flash card data is passed, render a fallback message.
  
  - **File:** `FlashCardList.tsx`
    - **Purpose:** Manage and display a deck of flash cards.
    - **Tasks:**
      - Import static flash card data using the helper file.
      - Maintain an index state to display one flash card at a time.
      - Provide navigation buttons (“Previous”, “Next”) with proper disabled states for the first/last card.
      - Optionally, add a “Mark as Known” button for future spaced-repetition enhancements.
      - Handle cases when the flash card array is empty by showing an appropriate error message.

### C. Flash Card Data Utility
- **File:** `src/lib/flashcards.ts`
  - **Purpose:** Store and retrieve sample flash card data.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Export a function (e.g. `getFlashcards()`) that returns an array of flash card objects with sample programming questions and answers.
    - Include error handling for data retrieval.

### D. Type Definitions Update
- **File:** `src/types/index.ts`
  - **Purpose:** Define the flash card data structure.
  - **Tasks:**
    - Add an interface:
      ```typescript
      export interface FlashCard {
        id: string;
        question: string;
        answer: string;
        category?: string;
      }
      ```
    - Export the interface for reuse in components.

## 2. Integration with Authentication and Routing

### A. Authentication Check
- In `src/app/flashcards/page.tsx`:
  - Import and use the `useAuth` hook from `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`.
  - If the user is not authenticated, render `<AuthScreen />` (from `src/components/auth/AuthScreen.tsx`) or trigger a redirect.
  
### B. Layout and Providers
- **File:** `src/app/layout.tsx`
  - **Tasks:**
    - Ensure the root layout wraps children within `<AuthProvider>` from `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`.
    - Optionally add a navigation menu with a link to the flashcards page.

---

## 3. UI/UX and Styling Enhancements

### A. Modern and Responsive Design
- Use only typography, colors, spacing, and layout (no icon libraries or external images).
- **Styling Updates:**
  - In `src/app/globals.css` (or create a dedicated CSS module for flashcards):
    - Define classes for `.flashcard-container`, `.flashcard`, `.flashcard-content`, and buttons.
    - Add CSS transitions for smooth card flip animations.
    - Ensure responsive layout: cards should scale appropriately on mobile and desktop.

### B. Error Handling Best Practices
- In each component (FlashCard and FlashCardList):
  - Validate props and state.
  - Provide fallback UI (e.g. “No flash cards available.”).
- In data retrieval (`src/lib/flashcards.ts`):
  - Use try/catch blocks if asynchronous fetching is implemented in future enhancements.

---

## 4. Documentation and Testing

### A. Update Documentation
- **File:** `README.md`
  - Include a section describing the flash cards feature and its usage.
- **File:** `TODO.md`
  - Add tasks related to flash cards and note future improvements (e.g. spaced repetition, progress tracking).

### B. Testing
- Manually test navigation and the card flip functionality by launching the app and navigating to `/flashcards`.
- Verify error handling by temporarily simulating empty flash card data.

## 5. Summary of Changes and Integrations

- Added a new Next.js route at `src/app/flashcards/page.tsx` to render flash cards.
- Created two new components (`FlashCard.tsx` and `FlashCardList.tsx`) in `src/components/flashcards/` for card display and navigation.
- Added a flash card data utility in `src/lib/flashcards.ts` and updated the type definitions in `src/types/index.ts`.
- Integrated authentication checks using `useAuth.ts` and safeguarded the flash card page by rendering `<AuthScreen />` for unauthenticated users.
- Updated global styling to ensure modern, responsive UI with smooth transitions and error boundaries.
- Documented the feature in `README.md` and `TODO.md` for future enhancements.
